Hi, I'm Antonio! 

I have a technical background and hold a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Applied Statistics (National University of Distance Studies)

After one year of transition from Engineering to Data Analysis, since June 2020 I dedicated most of my spare time to expand my knowledge about Data Science .


This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

# üèÉ A bit about myself:

While I was in my Calculus II lecture in my Mechanical Engineering Grade, I heard Ms. Ruiz say: "Statistics is not maths". 

That sentence sounded harsh for a teacher in Uni, she justified that by talking about how easy it is to modify a few measures so the statistical values could end up supporting two opposing views.

Later on in the course, I really understood that  Statistics is all about understanding data ‚Äì numbers with context and meaning. A computer can do all of the calculations and all of the numerical work by finding a mean, a standard deviation, and even a confidence interval (all things we do in statistics). 

But, only a person can tell you if the mean describes the data set or what the confidence interval is actually telling us.

Since then I developed a strange taste for wrangling with any new database that came to me. 
No matter if it was a cooling measure from a laser sensor from my Thermodynamics Class or a Database showing the relationship between Temperature and the strength of a given steel. 


# üõ† Skills
After that newly acquired hobby, I joined an Applied Statistics Master and I fell down the **Data Science** rabbit hole, becoming passionate about:

***How do I get the information I need fron this huge database?***

  To answer this question, I enrolled in a few Youtube and online courses about **SQL**.
  
  [You can find here some of my work on this topic](https://github.com/AntonioDelCastillo/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/tree/main/SQL) 
  
***Alright, I have the info, but now... How do I extract value from it?***

First I felt pretty overwhelmed by the number of resources available on the web, but I ended up using **Python** as a coding language. 
I knew how it worked due to some other side projects I made using the [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) book by Al Sweigart so it was a smooth start. 
  
Then I started learning how to use the basic tools for any Data Analyst such as __Pandas and SciKit Learn__, improving both the speed and quality of my analysis, compared to the speed that I could achieve using VBA in Excel.  


[Here you can appreciate my first steps with **Pandas**](https://github.com/AntonioDelCastillo/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Analysis/Pandas%20Basics.ipynb)


[And here we can find more advanced applications of both **Pandas and SciKit Learn**](https://github.com/AntonioDelCastillo/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/C%C3%A1lculos%20suicidio.ipynb)
    
***Okay, but not everyone likes numbers. How could I help them?***

  When I wanted to show my results to other people, they might not be able to understand how could affect some of the subtle changes in the confidence intervals or deviations, so I learned about making impactful presentations using my own charts, using both **Seaborn** for the Notebooks and **Tableau** for some specific dashboards.

***And what about Machine Learning?***

It was a matter of time until I became seduced by the potential of Machine Learning. So for my side projects, I had to learn some techniques such as: 

* [Linear Regression](https://github.com/AntonioDelCastillo/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/ML%20Snippets/Linear%20Regression.ipynb)
* [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/AntonioDelCastillo/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/ML%20Snippets/Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)
* [K Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/AntonioDelCastillo/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/ML%20Snippets/%20K%20Nearest%20Neighbors%20(KNN).ipynb)
* [Decision Trees and Random Forests](https://github.com/AntonioDelCastillo/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/ML%20Snippets/Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forests.ipynb)
* [Support Vector Machines and Parameter Tuning](https://github.com/AntonioDelCastillo/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/ML%20Snippets/Support%20Vector%20Machines.ipynb)
