# Hi, I'm Antonio! 👋 - Data Analysis Portfolio

Hi, I'm Antonio! 

I have a technical background and hold a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Applied Statistics (National University of Distance Studies)

After one year of transition from Engineering to Data Analysis, since June 2020 I dedicated most of my spare time to expand my knowledge about Data Science .


This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

# 🏃 A bit about myself:

While I was in my Calculus II lecture in my Mechanical Engineering Grade, I heard Ms. Ruiz say: "Statistics is not maths". 

That sentence sounded harsh for a teacher in Uni, she justified that by talking about how easy it is to modify a few measures so the statistical values could end up supporting two opposing views.

Later on in the course, I really understood that  Statistics is all about understanding data – numbers with context and meaning. A computer can do all of the calculations and all of the numerical work by finding a mean, a standard deviation, and even a confidence interval (all things we do in statistics). 

But, only a person can tell you if the mean describes the data set or what the confidence interval is actually telling us.

Since then I developed a strange taste for wrangling with any new database that came to me. 
No matter if it was a cooling measure from a laser sensor from my Thermodynamics Class or a Database showing the relationship between Temperature and the strength of a given steel.
