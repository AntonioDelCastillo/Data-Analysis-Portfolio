Hi, I'm Antonio! 

I have a technical background and hold a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Applied Statistics (National University of Distance Studies)

After one year of transition from Engineering to Data Analysis, since June 2020 I dedicated most of my spare time to expand my knowledge about Data Science .


This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
