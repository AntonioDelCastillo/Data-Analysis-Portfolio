# Hi, I'm Antonio! 👋 - Data Analysis Portfolio

Hi, I'm Antonio! 

I have a technical background and hold a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Applied Statistics (National University of Distance Studies)

After one year of transition from Engineering to Data Analysis, since June 2020 I dedicated most of my spare time to expand my knowledge about Data Science .


This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

# 🏃 A bit about myself:

While I was in my Calculus II lecture in my Mechanical Engineering Grade, I heard Ms. Ruiz say: "Statistics is not maths". 

That sentence sounded harsh for a teacher in Uni, she justified that by talking about how easy it is to modify a few measures so the statistical values could end up supporting two opposing views.

Later on in the course, I really understood that  Statistics is all about understanding data – numbers with context and meaning. A computer can do all of the calculations and all of the numerical work by finding a mean, a standard deviation, and even a confidence interval (all things we do in statistics). 

But, only a person can tell you if the mean describes the data set or what the confidence interval is actually telling us.

Since then I developed a strange taste for wrangling with any new database that came to me. 
No matter if it was a cooling measure from a laser sensor from my Thermodynamics Class or a Database showing the relationship between Temperature and the strength of a given steel. 


# 🛠 Skills
After that newly acquired hobby, I joined an Applied Statistics Master and I fell down the Data Science rabbit hole, becoming passionate about:

***¿How do I get the information I need fron this huge database?***

  To answer this question, I enrolled in a few Youtube and online courses about SQL.
  
  [You can find here some of my work on this topic](https://github.com/AntonioDelCastillo/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/tree/main/SQL) 
  
***Alright, I have the info, but now... ¿How do I extract value from it?***

First I felt pretty overwhelmed by the number of resources available on the web, but I ended up using Python as a coding language. 
I knew how it worked due to some other side projects I made using the [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) book by Al Sweigart so it was a smooth start. 
  
Then I started learning how to use the basic tools for any Data Analyst such as Pandas and SciKit Learn, improving both the speed and quality of my analysis, compared to the speed that I could achieve using VBA in Excel.  


[Here you can appreciate my first steps with Pandas](https://github.com/AntonioDelCastillo/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Analysis/Pandas%20Basics.ipynb)


[And here we can find more advanced applications of both Pandas and SciKit Learn](https://github.com/AntonioDelCastillo/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/C%C3%A1lculos%20suicidio.ipynb)
    
***Okay, but not everyone likes numbers. ¿How could I help them?***

  When I wanted to show my results to other people, they might not be able to understand how could affect some of the subtle changes in the confidence intervals or deviations, so I learned about making impactful presentations using my own charts, using both Seaborn for the Notebooks and Tableau for some specific dashboards.
